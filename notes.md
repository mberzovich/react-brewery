Dec 24 began but I had 15 hour days of work with the other jobs over the break.
I plan on finishing this for the practice.

working on the InfiniteScroll next and going to set only 10 to load, also I need
to make the beers and breweries links.

I want to work in a 'read more' function for the descriptions, and perhaps have
the current page be responsive to it.


m√°s trabajo por hacer!!
